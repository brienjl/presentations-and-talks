# Scrum: the weird parts

Scrum is a lightweight framework designed around the pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation. As players in the age of digital disruption, it’s our duty to move past the anti-patterns plaguing our organization by adopting an agile mindset and there is no better starting place than scrum.

This talk will dive deeper into some of the “weird parts” in scrum and how they relate to the three pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation.

Jeremy will distill some of the scrum concepts that tend to be a source of misunderstanding for beginners and advanced practitioners alike. Additionally, Jeremy will show us how to put these concepts into practice without throwing you too far into the deep end of the pool.
