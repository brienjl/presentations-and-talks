Presentaiton for PMI-NNV

## Introduction

- Thank you
- Introduction
- Overview of myself

## Scrum and Agile

- Scrum 101
  - empirical vs. predictive [1]
- Shouldn't agile adapt to my needs?
- Scrum but; scrummer-fall anti-patterns
- What scrum is and isn't:

  - It's not a silver bullet

  - It's a mechanism for feedback and does a great job at shining a light on what we don't do well...
    - this is why some people can be resistent to it when you first adopt it.
    - and why some people feel that scrum won't work for them.

## My Story -- How we improved Quality and reduced WIP

// todo

- lessons
  - if it hurts, do it more
  - elevate your constraints
  - teams must invest in a good CI/CD pipeline

## Story Points and Forecasting

- what's the difference
- signs of maturity: teams stop estimating and focus more on controlling WIP
- burn ups
  - fixed scope, variable time
  - fixed time, variable scope
  - always reduce scope to hit a date (because time is one resource we can spende and never get back)
- Observing the team with burn downs
  - we're not after speed
  - we want strable velocity
  - this is what makes this empirical and how we can forecast using real data
