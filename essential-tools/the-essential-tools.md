# [title] üìç sticky communication

## [subtitle] in your presentations, documents, and spreadsheets... 

## why...

# (ia) information architecture

regardless of the tool (word, docs, confluence, wiki, etc)
* ...always **provide a table of contents**
* ...mostly avoid jargon
* ...mostly write at a 5th grade level*
* ...always use **headers and bullets**

# üîé business writing in the wild
as we review, call out what aspects of the information architecture is working for you? 

* technical specs (simple english / bullets and tables / table of contents)
* business case (table of contents / navigation / good UX)
* a [webpage](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/) (headers and html markup)

# a final note on writing 

## headings and bullets

* book recommendation: **smart brevity**
    * we live in an increasingly distracted world

    * a well-written & formatted document can save you hours of meetings and repeating yourself

# üßÆ on spreadsheets (and databases)...
## anyone know what CRUD means?
if you're not building CRUD, you're probably using CRUD
* CRUD is the **lifecycle of a db**... and most apps we use every day
* databases come in two flavors (**transactional** & **analytical**)
* **spreadsheets** have the most **influence w/ decisions**... second to personality

`*the personality must be bigger than the prop - harry blackstone sr. (stage magician and illusionist) ‚ô†Ô∏è`

# types of dbs
* operational/transactions & analytical (OLTP & OLAP)
    * operational dbs are almost always relational databases
    * analytial dbs are almost always de-normalized databases

| db            | type | brands              | use case                             
| ---           | ---  | ---                 | ---                                  
| ops db        | OLTP | MS SQL, Oracle      | enterprise single-tenant data        
| analytical db | OLAP | Mongo, Snowflake    | analysis and decision making  
| noSQL db      | both | Mongo, Cassandra    | pocs & graph database types
| vector db     | OLAP | postgreSQL, elastic | ai/llms, large streaming, large search
| spreadsheet   | both | excel, sheets       | poc & ad-hoc analysis/decision making
| single-app dbs| OLTP | access, sqlite      | poc w/ CRUD functionality

# ü§† data wrangling the db
![bg right:40%](https://static-00.iconduck.com/assets.00/sql-database-sql-azure-icon-1955x2048-4pmty46t.png)
* we use **SQL (structured query language)** to wrangle data from **relational dbs**
    * every query has these 3 parts ‚ÄºÔ∏è
        1. **select** (the data you want)
        2. **from**   (from what table(s))
        3. **where**  (matching _y condition(s))
* **analytical dbs** typically use a higher level languages like dax and semantic models to interact w/ data

# üßë‚Äçüíª on presentations...
* **presentations are human artifacts** of company operations (projects, quarterlies, roadmaps, forks in the road, training materials, etc.)
* **goal complexity** and **level of effort** should dictate your approach
* presentations are **for the audience**, not the presenter
* information architecture applies
* the loom concept -- a quick recording and a slide deck can save you a meeting!
* **animate sparingly!!!**
